# ApBox

A suite of tools for users and developers on Aptos.

[Access ApBox here.](https://apbox.vercel.app/)

## Currently available tools:

### Coin Register

Creates a CoinStore resource on the users account. Useful for when you want to receive a specific Coin from a friend, but have not registered that CoinStore before.

[Learn more about the CoinStore standard](https://aptos.dev/concepts/coin-and-token/aptos-coin/#depositing-coins-into-coinstore)

## In the works:

### Coin Creator

Will allow users to create their own Coin very easily through a graphical interface, no need to mess around with CLI. Will allow custom symbol, name, icon and supply parameters.

### Educational content

Want to properly explain HOW these tools work, and WHY they are necessary.
